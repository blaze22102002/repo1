ALTER TABLE department ADD location VARCHAR(255)

insert into  employee values (6,'arjun',800000,10)
select * from employee

If the employee table has a foreign key constraint on Deptno that references the department table, the insertion of the employee will succeed because the department with Deptno 10 now exists in the department table after your previous insert.
The database enforces referential integrity, meaning you cannot add an employee to a department that does not exist. Since you added the department first, the insertion of the employee is valid.
